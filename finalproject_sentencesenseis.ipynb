Google provides the free online platform [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb), a research tool for machine learning education and research. It’s a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use as common packages have been  pre-installed. Google users can have access to a Tesla T4 GPU (approximately 15G memory). Note that when you connect to a GPU-based VM runtime, you are given a maximum of 12 hours at a time on the VM.\n",

    "Colab is web-based, fast and convinient. You can simply upload this notebook and run it online. For the database needed in this task, you can download it and upload to colab OR you can save it in your google drive and link it with the colab.\n",

    "- This is a group project. You are allowed to form groups in any way you like, but each group must consist of either 2 or 3 people. Please submit your group information to eDimension as soon as possible if you have not yet done so (the deadline was 11th October 2024).\n",

    "- You are given **8** weeks to work on the project. We understand this is a busy time during your final term, so Week **13** will be reserved as the \"Final Project Week\" for you to focus on the project (i.e., there will be no classes that week). Please plan and manage your time well.\n",

    "Welcome to the design project for our natural language processing (NLP) course offered at SUTD!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will undertake an NLP task in _sentiment analysis_. We will begin by guiding you through data understanding, pre-processing, and instructing you to construct RNN and CNN models for the task. Afterward, you are encouraged to develop your own model to improve the results. The final test set will be released on **11 December 2024 at 5pm** (48 hours before the final project deadline). You will use your own system to generate the outputs. The system with the highest F1 score will be announced as the winner for each challenge. If no clear winner emerges from the test set results, further analysis or evaluations may be conducted."

    "# Task Introduction and Data pre-processing (20 points)\n",
    "## Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "With the proliferation of online social media and review platforms, vast amounts of opinionated data have been generated, offering immense potential to support decision-making processes. Sentiment analysis examines people's sentiments expressed in text, such as product reviews, blog comments, and forum discussions. It finds wide applications in diverse fields, including politics (e.g., analyzing public sentiment towards policies), finance (e.g., evaluating market sentiments), and marketing (e.g., product research and brand management).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since sentiments can often be categorized into discrete polarities or scales (e.g., positive or negative), sentiment analysis can be framed as a text classification task. This task involves transforming text sequences of varying lengths into fixed-length categorical labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data pre-processing\n",
    "In this project, we will utilize [Stanford's large movie review dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/%7Eamaas/data/sentiment/) for sentiment analysis. The dataset consists of a training set and a testing set, each containing 25,000 movie reviews sourced from IMDb. Both datasets have an equal number of \"positive\" and \"negative\" labels, representing different sentiment polarities. Please download and extract this IMDb review dataset in the path `../data/aclImdb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hints*: While the following instructions are based on a split of 25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing, you are free to choose your own dataset split, as we will provide a separate test set for the final evaluation. However, any changes you make to the default split must be clearly indicated in your report. Failure to explicitly mention such modifications may result in a penalty.\n",

    "Similar to word similarity and analogy tasks, pre-trained word vectors can also be applied to sentiment analysis. Given that the IMDb review dataset is relatively small, using text representations pre-trained on large-scale corpora can help mitigate model overfitting. Each token can be represented using the pre-trained GloVe model, and these token embeddings can be fed into a multilayer bidirectional RNN to generate a sequence representation of the text, which will then be transformed into sentiment analysis outputs. Later, we will explore an alternative architectural approach for the same downstream task."

Following the instructions, please complete ``BiRNN`` class, each token in a text sequence receives its individual pre-trained GloVe representation through the embedding layer (``self.embedding``). The entire sequence is then encoded by a bidirectional RNN (``self.encoder``). Specifically, the hidden states from the last layer of the bidirectional LSTM, at both the initial and final time steps, are concatenated to form the representation of the text sequence. This representation is subsequently passed through a fully connected layer (``self.decoder``) to produce the final output categories, which in this case are \"positive\" and \"negative\"."

      "C:\\Users\\ASUS\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel_50920\\1815351604.py:21: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
